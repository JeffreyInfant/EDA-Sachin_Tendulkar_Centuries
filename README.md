Sachin Tendulkar's Centuries – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



**Project Objective**



This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on **Sachin Tendulkar's 100 international centuries**, aiming to uncover patterns based on opponent teams, batting positions, venue types, and match outcomes.







------



**Key Questions Explored**



\* Which teams did Sachin score the most centuries against?

\* Which batting position brought him the most success?

\* How did his performance differ across home, away, and neutral venues?

\* Did his centuries often result in a win?

\* How frequently did he score 150+ runs?



-------



**Key Insights**



\*  **Australia** is his favorite opponent, with **20 centuries** — that's 20% of his total centuries.

\*  Tendulkar was most successful at the **#4 batting position**, with **48 centuries**, followed by #2 with 40.

\*  He scored slightly more centuries at **home (42)** than away (41) or neutral (17) venues.

\*  **49 out of 100 centuries** led to Indian victories — **nearly** **half of his tons were match-winners**.

\*  He scored 150+ runs in 25 matches, showing his consistency in big innings.
